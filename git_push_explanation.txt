🔹 Step 1: Initialize a Git Repository
git init
- Initializes a new Git repository in your project folder.
- Creates a hidden `.git/` folder that stores the version history.
✅ Use this command only once per project.

🔹 Step 2: Stage All Files for Commit
git add .
- Stages all files in the project for the next commit.
- The `.` (dot) means "add everything" (new & modified files).
✅ Think of this like "selecting" files before saving changes permanently.

🔹 Step 3: Create an Initial Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"
- Saves (commits) all staged changes with a message.
- A commit is like a "snapshot" of the project at a specific moment.
✅ Commits allow you to go back to a previous version if needed.

🔹 Step 4: Rename the Default Branch to `main`
git branch -M main
- Renames the default branch from `master` to `main` (modern convention).

🔹 Step 5: Connect Your Local Repository to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
- Links your local project to a remote GitHub repository.
✅ You need to do this only once per project.

🔹 Step 6: Push Your Code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
- Uploads (pushes) your local code to the remote GitHub repository.
- The `-u` flag sets `main` as the default upstream branch.

✅ Next time, simply use `git push` instead.

🔹 Summary of the Workflow
| Command                     | Explanation                                    |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| git init                    | Initialize a Git repository.                  |
| git add .                   | Stage all files for commit.                   |
| git commit -m "message"     | Save a snapshot of your project.              |
| git branch -M main          | Rename default branch to `main`.              |
| git remote add origin URL   | Link local project to a GitHub repository.    | e.g., https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
| git push -u origin main     | Upload/push code to GitHub				      |

🔹 What’s Next?
1. Make new changes to your code.
2. Commit and push updates using:
   git add .
   git commit -m "Updated something"
   git push
3. Check your GitHub repository—your changes will be there! 🚀

🔹 Using Git in Anaconda Command Prompt

✅ You must navigate to the project folder (directory) where you want to use Git.
How to Navigate to Your Project Folder Path  & Move to That Folder in Anaconda Prompt

cd <path to your project folder>

❌ You don’t need to activate your leaflet environment for Git to work.
Git is separate from Anaconda environments.
You only need to activate the environment if you're running Python scripts related to the project.
	🔹 If you still want to activate your Anaconda environment:
		conda activate leaflet

4️⃣ Summary
Question	Answer
Do I need to be in the project folder?	✅ Yes (Use cd "your-folder-path")
Do I need to activate my Anaconda environment?	❌ No (Git works independently)
Can I use Git in Anaconda Prompt?	✅ Yes (As long as Git is installed)
Does Git affect my Python code?	❌ No (Git tracks changes, but does not run Python code)

✅ Final Checklist
✔ Navigate to your project folder (cd "path/to/folder")
✔ Run Git commands (git init, git add ., git commit -m "message", etc.)
✔ No need to activate Anaconda environment unless running Python scripts

🚀 Now you're ready to push your project to GitHub using Anaconda Command Prompt! 🎉 Let me know if you run into any issues. 😊
